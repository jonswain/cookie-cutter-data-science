# Cookiecutter Conda Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

## Requirements

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)
- [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html): This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Create a new project

In a folder where you want your project generated:

```bash
cookiecutter cookiecutter https://github.com/jonswain/cookie-cutter-data-science.git
```

If you have previously downloaded the template, you can use:

```bash
cookiecutter cookie-cutter-data-science
```
